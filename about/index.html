	<h1>Hand-rendered artwork and design</h1>
	<p>With roots based in draftsmanship and traditional sign painting, I create work in response to unique and personal briefs, hoping to highlight the 'human' in the process, approach and execution. I focus on using a multitude of techniques, spanning across various media and play with traditional creative approaches.
