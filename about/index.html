	<h1>Hi there, I'm Hank Quinlan!</h1>
	<p>Hand-rendered artwork and design​.

With roots based in draftsmanship and traditional sign painting, I create work in response to unique and personal briefs, hoping to highlight the 'human' in the process, approach and execution. I focus on using a multitude of techniques, spanning across various media and play with traditional creative approaches.
